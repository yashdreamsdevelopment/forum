        <h1>Forum Rules:</h1>
        <div class="container my-3">
            <h2>1. No Spam / Advertising / Self-promote in the forums</h2>
            <p>These forums define spam as unsolicited advertisement for goods, services and/or other web sites, or
                posts with little, or completely unrelated content. Do not spam the forums with links to your site or
                product, or try to self-promote your website, business or forums etc.
                Spamming also includes sending private messages to a large number of different users.
                <b>Your account will be banned permanently and your posts will be deleted.</b>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container my-3">
            <h2>2. Do not post copyright-infringing material</h2>
            <p>Providing or asking for information on how to illegally obtain copyrighted materials is forbidden.</b>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container my-3">
            <h2>3. Do not post “offensive” posts, links or images</h2>
            <p>Any material which constitutes defamation, harassment, or abuse is strictly prohibited. Material that is
                sexually or otherwise obscene, racist, or otherwise overly discriminatory is not permitted on these
                forums. This includes user pictures. Use common sense while posting.
                This is a web site for accountancy professionals.</b>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container my-3">
            <h2>4. Do not cross post questions</h2>
            <p>Please refrain from posting the same question in several forums. There is normally one forum which is
                most suitable in which to post your question.</b>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container my-3">
            <h2>5. Do not PM users asking for help</h2>
            <p>Do not send private messages to any users asking for help. If you need help, make a new thread in the
                appropriate forum then the whole community can help and benefit.</b>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container my-3">
            <h2>6. Remain respectful of other members at all times</h2>
            <p>All posts should be professional and courteous. You have every right to disagree with your fellow
                community members and explain your perspective.

                However, you are not free to attack, degrade, insult, or otherwise belittle them or the quality of this
                community. It does not matter what title or power you hold in these forums, you are expected to obey
                this rule.</b>
